Overview
ML-method data analysis automates analytical model building, algorithms iteratively learn from data, find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed

Recomendatione engines, text sentiment analysis, patter/image recognition, spam filtering, predict customer churn, equipment failures, web search results, fraud detection, new pricing models

ML process- aquire data, clean, model training and building, model testing on test data iterate, then deploy model

supervised-labelled ata try preict label of known features, desired output known, algorithm compares actual output to predicted to calculate error
Through classification, regression, prediction and gradient boosting, uses patterns to predict values of label on additional unlabeled data.
used where historical data predicts future events

unsupervised-unabeled  data, try to group similar points based off features
Algoirhtm most explore data, determine what is being shown
Find main attributes to segment data, e.g. self-organizing maps, nearest neighbour, k-means, singular value decomposition
segment text topics, make recommendations, identify outliers

reinforcement learning- learn to perform action from experience
determine which action has greatest reward, used robotics gaming, navigation, trial error
agent- learner/decision maker, environment (everyhting agent interacts with)
actions - what agent can do
Objective maximise award over time, maximises reward by choose correct policy.

scikit-learn package
conda install scikit-learn
split data into test and training set 
Every algorithm in scikit-earn exposed via an Estimator, import model
from sklearn.family import modelname
Once model created with parameters, need to split data using e.g. cross_validation.train_test_split

Train/fit model on training data, 
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

unsupervised different as dont have labels
predictions=model.predict(test)
Evaluation method depends on technique used: regression,classification, clustering

on all Estimators:
mode.fit(), supervised model.fit(X,y), unsupervised model.fit(X)

model.predict(X_new) supervised predict label based unseen data
model.predict_proba() For classification problems, returns probability each new observation has each categorical label, hgihest prob is returned by model.predict()

model.score()  supervised estimators, classification/regression probles, score between 0 and 1, larger score indicating a better fit
model.predict() #predict labels in clustering for unsupervised
model.transform(X) unsupervised, transform new data into new basis, accepts X, returns representation of data based on unsupervised model
model.fit_transform() unsupervised, more efficiently perform a fit and transform on same input data
