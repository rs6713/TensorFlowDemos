multiple versions of python or libraries and easily activate/deactivate
Different versions of library, when versions not backward compatible, 
ensure python 2.7 and python 3.5 
anaconda has a built in virtual environment manager
conda create --name environame biopython (base package)
/envs/environame (if base package not specified will use default used to install anaconda)

deactivate 
conda create --name mypython3 python=3.5 anaconda
anaconda- specifies all anaconda default packages, does all with python 3.5
conda info --envs lists environments
